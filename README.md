# DTW-based Morris GSA for Dynamical Systems
This is the repository for our paper:
"Fortela, D. L.; Mikolajczyk, A.; Hernandez, R.; Revellame, E.; Sharp, W.; Holmes, W.; Zappi, M. E. Dynamic Time Warping as Elementary Effects Metric for Morris-based Global Sensitivity Analysis of High-dimension Dynamical Models.

This Python module will be moved from the TestPyPi into the PyPi repository for wider dissemination.

There are three items in this repository:
1) The Python source code for the DTWMorrisGSA under the "src" folder.
2) The Jupyter Notebook workflow to replicate the computational work for Examples (1,2,3) done in the paper.
3) The R-scipts used to perform the final data analysis and other graphics rendering. 

This current Python module ""DTWMorrisGSA" was built by utilizing the existing Morris Screening code implementation
by: Cuntz, Mai et al. (Water Res Research, 2015); GitHub repo: https://github.com/mcuntz/pyeee. We are grateful for this prior work.
